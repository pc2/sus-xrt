# 20x256bit Memory reader benchmark 348MHz

This case isn't so clear-cut as the 512-bit case. Certainly because the Bandwidth doesn't seem to conflict as much as the cycle counter. This indicates that the kernels probably ran serially in some of the tests. The question remains: why? Could it be that the control signals also conflict with the memory transfers?
